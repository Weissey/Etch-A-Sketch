This project surpassed my expectations of how difficult it would be immediately following the construction of V1 functions responsible for setting up the grid and how every element was going to be interacting with each other.

The code has been completely rewritten at least [1] time(s).

V2 siginifically increases readability and functionality by fully utilizing variables and constants, therefore reducing code bloat and confusion.

There exists a more efficient way of constructing grids rather than creating the x-axis first then filling them with downdrop containers.

Shoutout to https://github.com/michalosman, majority of my code was inspired from his as I learned more efficient methods at managing variables and functions.
- Reading Michal's code really opened my eyes to what my code **should've** been, but instead I'm not at that level yet.

From here on out, I will approach creating code from a more minimal and efficient way, inspired by Michal.
